# AI Live English Subtitles

🚀 **Inspiration**

Many websites today still don’t offer reliable captions, even though so much of our learning and entertainment happens online. Videos, lectures, interviews, tutorials — all of them rely on clear audio, and not everyone catches every word the first time. Background noise, fast speakers, complex terminology, or accents can make it difficult to follow along.

Instead of hunting for transcripts or replaying sections over and over, this extension creates a simple way to see exactly what’s being said in real time. It brings accurate, natural English subtitles to any webpage, no matter where the audio is coming from. The goal is to make online content more accessible, easier to understand, and smoother to follow without changing how you browse.
